<h2>Powell Smash</h2>

<p class="pcenter">Powell Smash is a local organization of SSBM players north of Columbus in Central Ohio.</p>

<p class="pcenter">We run free-to-enter tournaments pretty much every weekend at someone&#39;s house, and attend public tournaments, as well as hosting two to three major, public tournaments with a buy-in a year. We are looking to grow, and if you are nearby Powell or Lewis Center, Ohio, send an email to powellsmash@gmail.com to get involved!</p>
