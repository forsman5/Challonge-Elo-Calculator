#This is a setting to turn on or off the alias suggestion feature.

#If turned on, it will compare a name which has no records to all the aliases in the database.

#Similarity is determined if the number of characters in the string that are shared is greater than the 
#number of different characters. TODO - REVISE?

#If it is suggested, then TODO

#save to a new db?
