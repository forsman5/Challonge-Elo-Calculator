###The pound sign is a comment character.###
#Only add comments at the top block of comments, none after or between variables.
#    It may work if you do, but no guarantees.
#For each of these lines, edit only the area after the equals sign.
#DO NOT EDIT THE ORDER OR ANYTHING BEFORE A "=". This will cause a fatal error.
#Any errors in the written paths may cause fatal, undiagnosable errors. Be careful.
